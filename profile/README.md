# Purdue Hackers 💛

We're a community of students who collaborate, learn, and build kick-ass creative-technical projects ⚡️

Most people on campus know us for [Hack Night](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-50), a mini-hackathon every Friday night from 8pm to when the last person leaves, on the second floor of the Bechtel Innovation and Design Center, with 80 hackers every week 🌙

This organization contains all of our open-source projects and documentation :)
